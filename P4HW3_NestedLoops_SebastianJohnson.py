# CTI-110 P4HW3 - Nested Loops
# Sebastian Johnson




#Pseudocode
#1. start the for loop
#2. assign start, stop, and step
#3. assign a print function to the first for in order to get your fist "#", make sure to stop that line with end=''
#4. start a new for loop for the spaces that you want to add
#5. close the loop with a print function that will add a # after the spaces

    for c in range(r+0):
        print(' ',end='')
